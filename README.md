Streamline Processing Using Kafka<br>

This project demonstrates a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka, Python, and a trained Machine Learning model. It simulates data streaming using Kafka producers and consumers, processes sales data, and makes predictions using a trained model.

 Project Overview<br>
	•	Kafka_producer.py – Sends data (simulated) to the Kafka topic.<br>
	•	Kafka_consumer.py – Consumes the data from Kafka for processing.<br>
	•	datapreprocess.py – Preprocessing module for raw dataset.<br>
	•	model.py – Loads the trained model and makes predictions.<br>
	•	trained_model.pkl – Serialized machine learning model.<br>
	•	dataset.csv – Raw input dataset.<br>
	•	preprocessed_summer_clothing_sales.csv – Cleaned version of the dataset.<br>
